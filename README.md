## Introduction
* Overview: This project is a part of NYU Computer Vision 2025 Spring HW1, focusing on image classification using deep learning.
* Task: Classify images into 100 categories, using a dataset of 21,024 training/validation images and 2,344 test images.
* Approach: Utilized ResNet50 with modifications (e.g., customized fc layer), advanced data augmentation, LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy loss, and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA). Achieved a final validation accuracy of 90%.
## How to install
* Environment: This project was executed on Google Colab with an L4 GPU (24GB memory).
* Dependencies:
  * Python 3.8+ (pre-installed in Colab)
  * PyTorch (torch, torchvision)
  * Additional libraries: pandas, matplotlib, tqdm
