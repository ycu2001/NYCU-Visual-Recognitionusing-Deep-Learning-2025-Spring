## Introduction

This project focuses on image restoration for degraded images caused by rain and snow, using a model trained from scratch without any external data. I implemented and experimented with variants of the PromptIR architecture and finally developed a **Prompt + SwinIR hybrid model** with **Charbonnier Loss** and **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**. The final model achieved a test PSNR of 26.28dB and .

## How to install
1. Download `cv_hw4.ipynb` and `model_swinir.py`.
2. Put them in the same directory as your dataset.
3. Check the path name of the files, then run `cv_hw4.ipynb` in colab.
