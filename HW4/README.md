This project focuses on image restoration for degraded images caused by rain and snow, using a model trained from scratch without any external data. I implemented and experimented with variants of the PromptIR architecture and finally developed a **Prompt + SwinIR hybrid model** with **Charbonnier Loss** and **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**. The final model achieved a test PSNR of 26.28dB and .
